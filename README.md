# Bayesian Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive study and application of the paper titled "Variational Learning of Inducing Variables in Sparse Gaussian Processes" by M. Titsias. The objective is to explore the methodologies and implications of the introduction sparse Gaussian Process methods in regression tasks.
